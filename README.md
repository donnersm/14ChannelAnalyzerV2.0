14 Channel Spectrum analyzer V2.0
About this project
This document is related to the 14 channel Spectrum analyser. It has 14 frequency bins (channels) and each bin is built with 20 acrylic tiles and LEDS. ( WS2812 Pixels).
You can connect your audio signal by using the audio input or you can use the build in microphone. Although using the microphone will limit the frequency response because of its limitations.
You can adjust input sensitivity, brightness, and peak hold time. It also has several modes that you can use to change the colour of the LEDS. When it does not receive any input signal, after a while, it will go to rainbow mode in which all towers will light up in the colours of the rainbow.
My prototype was built with acrylics and some electronics.  The files to duplicate the acrylic parts are available for download but you might need to tweak them to your specific situation or design. I designed a PCB for the electronics. The PCB can be purchased at my Tindie web shop. 
The firmware (Arduino Sketch ) is open source and you can modify it to your needs.
